Initial Page Load:

The browser requests the main HTML document (ex1.html).
The HTML document includes references to CSS (styles.css) and JavaScript files (script.js and jquery-3.6.0.min.js), which the browser requests from the server.
The server responds with these resources, allowing the browser to render the initial web page.

Search Action:

When the user enters a search term (e.g., "cat") and triggers the search functionality (likely via an event listener in the JavaScript code), an AJAX request is sent to the server with the search query.
The server processes the query and responds with a JSON object containing URLs of images matching the search term.
The browser then makes individual requests for each image URL provided in the server's response.
The server responds with the image files, which the browser displays on the page.
